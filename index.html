        <p>
          I'm a final-year Computer Science student at FAST-NUCES with a strong
          interest in technology, problem-solving, and innovation. I enjoy
          exploring new technologies and working on projects that have
          real-world impact.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of academics, I’ve been actively involved in debating and
          public speaking, which has helped me develop strong communication and
          analytical skills. Sports, especially football and cricket, have
          taught me teamwork and perseverance—values I apply in both my personal
          and professional life.

          <p>
            Sportify is an automated sports venue booking and management system
            designed to streamline how players discover, book, and manage sports
            facilities in Pakistan. Built using Flutter for the frontend and
            Node.js for the backend, it offers real-time venue availability,
            instant booking approvals, slot reallocation, and automated
            scheduling. The admin panel enables venue owners to manage bookings,
            track payments, and handle user approvals seamlessly, while
            real-time notifications keep users updated on booking status and
            payments. Sportify aims to revolutionize sports management by making

          <p>
            Hash Limo stands as a dynamic marketplace connecting the vehicle
            owner with individuals seeking short-term transportation solutions.
            Hash Limo has emerged as a leading booking service, driven by the
            global appetite for seamless travel experiences in several states of
            USA. In Pakistan, where traditional car/auto bookings prevail due to
            their low costs, a substantial market remains largely untapped. This
            presents a strategic opportunity for Hash Limo to provide affordable
            mobility solutions, tapping into this extensive market potential.

          <h3>SORTING ALGORITHMS LIBRARY</h3>
          <p class="project-description"></p>
          <p>
            Unlike high-level languages, Assembly lacks an extensive set of
            libraries for common tasks. To address this limitation, I developed
            a sorting algorithms library that simplifies programming by
            providing pre-defined implementations of various sorting techniques,
            including Heap, Merge, Insertion, Selection, Gnome, Shaker, Bubble,
            and Cocktail Sort. This library significantly reduces coding time,
            enabling programmers to focus on more critical aspects of their
            projects while leveraging optimized sorting methods. By streamlining
            algorithm implementation in Assembly, this project enhances
            efficiency and improves the accessibility of sorting functions for
            low-level programming tasks.
